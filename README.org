* systray-popup-fix

The problem:

- Click the volume icon in the systray. Notice the popup size
- Increase the global scale one step, apply with =plasmashell --replace=
- Click the volume icon, notice the popup has become larger
- Set the global scale back, apply with =plasmashell --replace=
- Click the volume icon, notice the popup is still big
- Affected versions: 23.04, 23.10, 24.04
- Fixed in: 24.10

The solution:

- =systemctl --user edit plasma-workspace.service=
- add such section:

 #+begin_example
   [Service]
   ExecStartPre=-/path/to/the/script
 #+end_example

- it would wipe the saved popup size from the config on plasma start
- this fix is applied on relog, =plasmashell --replace= case is not covered

Tech details:

- =plasma-framework= package
  - =src/plasmaquick/dialog.cpp=
    - =DialogPrivate::updateSizeFromAppletInterface()= loads the saved popup
      size
    - =Dialog::hideEvent()= saves the popup size
