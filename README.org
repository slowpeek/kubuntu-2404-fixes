* forget-widget-size

The problem:

- Click the volume icon in the systray. Notice the popup size
- Increase the global scale one step, apply with =plasmashell --replace=
- Click the volume icon, notice the popup has become larger
- Set the global scale back, apply with =plasmashell --replace=
- Click the volume icon, notice the popup is still big
- Affected versions: 23.04, 23.10, 24.04
- Fixed in: 24.10

The same happens with the calendar popup, when you click of the digital clock
widget. Likely, all popups are like that.

Also, widgets' config dialogs are affected. For example, the digital clock's
one.

The solution:

- =systemctl --user edit plasma-workspace.service=
- add such section:

 #+begin_example
   [Service]
   ExecStartPre=-/path/to/the/script
 #+end_example

- it would wipe all saved sizes from the config on plasma start. The relevant
  config file is =~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc=
- this fix is applied on relog, =plasmashell --replace= case is not covered

For tech details, look into the =plasma-framework= package's sources:
- =src/plasmaquick/configview.cpp= (config dialogs)
- =src/plasmaquick/dialog.cpp= (popups)
